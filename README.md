## About Cue

Cue is a free program for controlling theatre sound cues. It is very much inspired by [SCS] (http://www.showcuesystems.com).

Cue started out as an idea to create a software for theatre audio. The goal was to get a simple but effective solution for playing audio in live shows and Cue has accomplished just that. The program has been developed by Jaakko Rinta-Filppula since the start of the project in fall 2011.

Cue is developed in PureBasic and uses [BASS] (http://www.un4seen.com) library
for sound handling. Also, BASS_VST is used to enable VST plugins.
